# password-manager

This simple cli tool has two abilities at the moment:
- generate password with custom length (provided by the user)
- save the generated password and display it.

Future ideas:
- List all saved passwords.
- Show last saved password.
- Remove old passwords ( passwords you don`t want to use anymore.)
- Probably develop GUI version with tkinter or pyQT.(or both, or some modern gui framework.)
- Think for a way to improve password generation.(better way)
- Think for a way to improve password storing.(better way)
