# password-manager

This simple cli tool has two abilities at the moment:
- generate password with custom length (provided by the user)
- save the generated password and display it.
- show list of all saved passwords.
- show last saved password.

Future ideas:
- ~~List all saved passwords.~~ -> Done
- ~~Show last saved password.~~ -> Done
- ~~Remove old passwords ( passwords you don`t want to use anymore.)~~ -> Done
- Probably develop GUI version with tkinter or pyQT.(or both, or some modern gui framework.)
- Think for a way to improve password generation.(better way)
- Think for a way to improve password storing.(better way)
