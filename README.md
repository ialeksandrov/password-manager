# password-manager

This simple cli tool has two abilities at the moment:
- generate password with custom length (provided by the user)
- save the generated password and display it.

Future ideas:
- List all saved passwords.
- List last saved password.
- Probably develop GUI version with tkinter or pyQT.(or both, or some modern gui framework.)
- Think for a way to improve password generation.(better way)
- Think for a way to improve password storing.(bettwe way)
